# TODO App

At first glance this is just another TODO app, however the main focus here is the experimentation with integration with other technologies.

## Running it:

The app is currently divided into two main folders: frontend and backend which run separately.

**Backend**
The backend was created entirely using the Feathers generator, which can be found [here](https://feathersjs.com/). 
To run the backend, simply cd into it's folder, run `npm install` and do an `npm start`

**Frontend**
The frontend was generated using React's own `create-react-app` generator. More details on this can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

To run the frontend, simply cd into it's folder run another `npm install` and do another `npm start`

## Other notes:

It is important to note that the main focus of this app is not the TODO application itself, but the integration with other technologies, which will be updated and reported on as the development continues.
